# act_out

Charades gets an upgrade from pen and paper to a web app.

1. A party host creates a game with desired settings (category, words per player, name, etc)
2. Participants can find that game on the homepage
3. Participants then add words to the game
4. Once all words have been submitted, players pass around a single phone or tablet
