Charades gets an upgrade from pen and paper to a web app.

Party hosts can create a game of charades which gets added to the homepage automatically. 

From there, participants can add words to the "bowl" from any smartphone or computer.

Once the group is ready to play, one person's phone or tablet is passed around the circle, where every other person is on the same team.

_Created using Django, jQuery, and MaterializeCSS._
